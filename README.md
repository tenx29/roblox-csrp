# Roblox Cross-Server Routing Protocol

This repository contains the functional specification for the Cross-Server Routing Protocol used to route messages using Roblox's [MessagingService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/MessagingService).

The specifications for each major version of the protocol are located in the corresponding folder.

## Contributing

If you are proposing a new major version of the protocol, please open an issue first to discuss the changes. Major versions are defined as any version that is not compatible with a previous version of the protocol.
